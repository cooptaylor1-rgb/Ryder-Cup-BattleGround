# Ryder Cup BattleGround — Improvement Worklog (Lobster)

## 2026-02-04 09:30 EST — Phase 1 (batch 1)
- Schedule page: removed “indefinite skeleton” when no trip is selected; now shows a Premium empty state with a clear CTA back home.
- Schedule page: added explicit error empty state + retry for match loading failures (no more silent console-only failures).
